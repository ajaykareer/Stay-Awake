# 💤 Stay Awake – Prevent Screen Lock

A tiny and powerful web page that keeps your screen **awake** using a smart video loop trick. Perfect for laptops, Android, and office desktops where screen timeout settings are annoying. 🙄

## 🌟 Features
- Keeps your phone or computer screen on using a looping video.
- No downloads, no ads, just one clean HTML file.
- Centered message: `Stay Awake 😴❌`
- Fully responsive and dark-mode friendly.
- Works automatically – no tap required.

## 🛠 How it Works
This page auto-plays a hidden 1-second black video on loop to prevent your device from sleeping. The technique works on most modern browsers and devices **except iPhones**.

> ⚠️ **iOS Note**:  
> Due to restrictions in iOS (especially iOS 16+), this solution does **not** prevent screen dimming on iPhones. Safari blocks background video and JavaScript-based wake mechanisms unless full-screen video or physical input is used. Consider using a physical screen tapper for iOS devices.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Open [index.html](./index.html) in any modern browser.
2. Or visit the live site:  
   👉 https://stayawake.netlify.app/
3. Leave the tab open and your screen won’t lock!

## 📱 Ideal For
- Laptops and desktops
- Android devices
- Watching dashboards or reading long docs
- Preventing lockouts during Zoom or Teams calls
- DIY screen tapping robot experiments for iOS

## ⚠️ Limitations
- **iPhones**: iOS Safari blocks background autoplay and Wake Lock API – screen will still dim 😤
- **Power saving settings** on some laptops may override browser behavior — tweak OS settings if needed

## 💻 Tech Stack
- Pure HTML
- JavaScript
- Inline CSS (no frameworks needed)
