# 💤 Stay Awake – Prevent Screen Lock

A tiny and powerful web page that keeps your screen **awake** using the Wake Lock API. Perfect for office devices where screen timeout settings are restricted (like some iPhones 😤).

## 🌟 Features
- Keeps your phone or computer screen on.
- No downloads, no ads, just one clean HTML file.
- Centered message: `Stay Awake 😴❌`
- Fully responsive and dark-mode friendly.

## 🛠 How it Works
This uses the [Wake Lock API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Wake_Lock_API) to prevent your screen from sleeping. It requests a lock on the screen when you open the page in your browser.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Open [index.html](./index.html) in any modern browser.
2. Or visit the live site:  
   👉 https://stayawake.netlify.app/
3. Leave the tab open — that’s it!

## 📱 Ideal For
- Office phones with restricted settings.
- Watching data dashboards.
- Coding/reading without the screen going dark.
- DIY touch tapper testing.

## ⚠️ Note
- Some browsers or locked-down devices may block the Wake Lock API.
- Keep your phone plugged in if using this for long durations.

## 💻 Tech Stack
- Pure HTML
- JavaScript
- Inline CSS (no frameworks needed)
